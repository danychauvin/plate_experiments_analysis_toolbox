## How to use it?

Create a project folder, containing plate experiments data in a subfolder data/. Clone this repo within your project folder, and use it.

### List and format of data to import

Two data formats are currently supported.

**Format 1**:
Each plate measurement is a single file. The name of the file contains the date of the measurement. For instance, in a case where we measure both OD at 600 nm and fluorescence in the GFP channel:

```

```

**Format 2**:
A single file per plate. Two consecutive measurement are separated by a empty line. For instance, in the case where we are only interested in measuring the OD at 600 nm:

For **Format 1**, use read_bulk_format_1.R, for **Format 2**, use read_bulk_format_2.R.

Both these scripts use a 'data list' csv file as an input, which lists all data **folders** that have to be considered, together with other useful information (conditions, experimental data, etc.). These information will be propagated to the output tidied table that will be used for further analysis.

### Importing all data

An example script is given in the repo: data_analysis_format_2.Rmd.
